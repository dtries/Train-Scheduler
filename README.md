# Which Train When
Styled webpage for adding train schedule information and viewing information regarding train arrivals. Upon page load a running clock with the present time is displayed, a train schedule table populates with any information already present in firebase, and a form area is provided to add additional trains to the database. Adding a train also updates the table with the new train information appended in a new table row at the bottom of the table. The information in the table includes train name, destination, frequency of service in minutes, next arrival time, and how many minutes until the next trian arrives. The information for next arrival time and the number of minutes until the next train arrives is updated at the top of each minute sweep of the clock.
